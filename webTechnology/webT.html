                            The client-server model is a core concept in web technology. In this architecture, the
                            <b>client</b>
                            (such as a web browser or mobile app) initiates communication by sending requests for data
                            or
                            services. The <b>server</b> (such as a web server or database server) listens for these
                            requests,
                            processes them, and sends back the appropriate responses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This separation allows clients and servers to perform specialized tasks: clients handle user
                            interaction and display, while servers manage data storage, security, and business logic.
                            Communication typically happens over the internet using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Client:</b> Requests information or services (e.g., loading a web page).</li>
                            <li><b>Server:</b> Responds with the requested data or performs actions (e.g., serving HTML,
                                processing form submissions).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The client-server model makes web applications scalable, secure, and easier to maintain.
                            Most
                            websites, online services, and apps use this model to deliver content and functionality to
                            users.

                            Web applications are made up of several key components that work together to deliver
                            interactive
                            and
                            dynamic experiences to users. The main components include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Client-Side (Front-End):</b> The part of the application that runs in the user's
                                browser.
                                It
                                includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which handle the user interface, layout, and
                                interactivity.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Server-Side (Back-End):</b> The part that runs on the web server. It processes
                                requests,
                                manages data, performs business logic, and communicates with databases. Common
                                technologies
                                include Node.js, PHP, Python, Java, and .NET.</li>
                            <li><b>Database:</b> Stores and manages data for the application. Examples include MySQL,
                                MongoDB,
                                PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.</li>
                            <li><b>Communication Protocols:</b> Define how data is exchanged between client and server,
                                typically using HTTP or HTTPS.</li>
                            <li><b>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</b> Allow different software components or
                                services to communicate and share data, often using REST or GraphQL.</li>
                            <li><b>Web Server:</b> Hosts the application, handles client requests, and serves files.
                                Examples
                                include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            These components work together to provide a seamless user experience, enabling users to
                            interact
                            with web applications efficiently and securely.

                            <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the
                            web. It
                            defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should
                            respond
                            to various commands.

                        <p>
                            An <b>HTTP request</b> is sent by a client (usually a web browser) to a server when you
                            visit a
                            website or interact with a web application. The request asks for resources such as HTML
                            pages,
                            images, or data. The server processes the request and sends back an <b>HTTP response</b>
                            containing
                            the requested content or an error message.
