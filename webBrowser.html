   <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>A web server is specialized software running on a remote machine that’s designed to host, store, and serve web content—like HTML pages, images, stylesheets, and scripts. When you enter a URL or click a link in your browser, that browser sends a request via HTTP or HTTPS to the web server. The server then processes the request—fetching the appropriate files or generating content dynamically—and sends back the response. The web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) receives this response and renders the content visually, allowing you to navigate the web, interact with pages, click buttons, fill in forms, and more</b>
    <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>Web browsers and web servers are fundamental components of the internet, working together to deliver web content to users. A web browser is a client-side application that allows users to access and view web pages, while a web server is a server-side application that stores and delivers the web content.</b> </p>

<b>WHAT IS A WEB BROWSER?<b>
<br>
<p>A web browser also simply called a browser is a software application that lets you access, retrieve, and view content on the World Wide Web.
    A web browser acts as your gateway to the internet, letting you visit websites, view text, images, videos, and interact with online content.
    It communicates with web servers using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to fetch data (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, media files), then renders this data into the visual pages you interact with.

    How It Works: Behind the Scenes
     <br><ol type="1">
        <br>
     <li> URL entry & DNS lookup
         You enter a URL (e.g., www.example.com). The browser translates this human-readable domain into an IP address via a DNS lookup.
    </li>
<br>
   <li> HTTP request & server response
        The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server, which responds by sending back resources—HTML markup, style sheets, scripts, images, and more.
    </li>
<br>
     <li>Rendering
        The browser employs a rendering engine to parse and display the page. It interprets HTML for structure, CSS for appearance, and JavaScript for behavior and interactivity.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>Additional features

        Caching: Stores copies of resources to speed up future visits.
      

        Cookies & sessions: Records small files to remember preferences or login states.
        </li>
    <br>
   
   
<b>WHAT IS A WEB SERVER?<b>
    <p>A web server—in both hardware and software form—is an indispensable component of the internet, retrieving and delivering web content upon client requests via HTTP/HTTPS. Whether serving static pages or supporting dynamic applications, web servers form the backbone of websites, APIs, and online services, all while managing performance, security, and access.</p>
<br>
<br> 
    
    <br>
    
<b>How Does a Web Server Work?<b>
    <br>
<br><ol type="1">
    <li>Client Request
    A web browser (client) types in a URL, triggering an HTTP/HTTPS request to the web server.
    <br><br>
   <li> DNS Lookup
    The browser uses DNS to find the server’s IP address.
    <br><br>
    <li>Connection Established
    The browser connects to the server over TCP (commonly port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).
    <br><br><li>Process Request
    The server receives and interprets the HTTP request—determining whether the client wants a static file or dynamic content.
   <br><br>
   <li>
    Serve Content or Generate Response

        Static content: served directly from stored files.

        Dynamic content: generated on-the-fly using backend logic or databases (through an application server).
<br><br>
    <li>Send Response or Error
    The server sends the desired content back to the browser—or returns an error (e.g., 404 Not Found).
